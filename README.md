# AsyncHTTPClient
This package provides an HTTP Client library built on top of SwiftNIO.

This library provides the following:
- First class support for Swift Concurrency
- Asynchronous and non-blocking request methods
- Simple follow-redirects (cookie headers are dropped)
- Streaming body download
- TLS support
- Automatic HTTP/2 over HTTPS
- Cookie parsing (but not storage)

## Getting Started

#### Adding the dependency
Add the following entry in your <code>Package.swift</code> to start using <code>HTTPClient</code>:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client.git", from: "1.9.0")
```
and  `AsyncHTTPClient` dependency to your target:
```swift
.target(name: "MyApp", dependencies: [.product(name: "AsyncHTTPClient", package: "async-http-client")]),
```

#### Request-Response API

The code snippet below illustrates how to make a simple GET request to a remote server.

```swift
import AsyncHTTPClient

/// MARK: - Using Swift Concurrency
let request = HTTPClientRequest(url: "https://apple.com/")
let response = try await HTTPClient.shared.execute(request, timeout: .seconds(30))
print("HTTP head", response)
if response.status == .ok {
    let body = try await response.body.collect(upTo: 1024 * 1024) // 1 MB
    // handle body
} else {
    // handle remote error
}


/// MARK: - Using SwiftNIO EventLoopFuture
HTTPClient.shared.get(url: "https://apple.com/").whenComplete { result in
    switch result {
    case .failure(let error):
        // process error
    case .success(let response):
        if response.status == .ok {
            // handle response
        } else {
            // handle remote error
        }
    }
}
```

If you create your own `HTTPClient` instances, you should shut them down using `httpClient.shutdown()` when you're done using them. Failing to do so will leak resources.
 Please note that you must not call `httpClient.shutdown` before all requests of the HTTP client have finished, or else the in-flight requests will likely fail because their network connections are interrupted.

### async/await examples

Examples for the async/await API can be found in the [`Examples` folder](./Examples) in this Repository.

## Usage guide

The default HTTP Method is `GET`. In case you need to have more control over the method, or you want to add headers or body, use the `HTTPClientRequest` struct:

#### Using Swift Concurrency

```swift
import AsyncHTTPClient

do {
    var request = HTTPClientRequest(url: "https://apple.com/")
    request.method = .POST
    request.headers.add(name: "User-Agent", value: "Swift HTTPClient")
    request.body = .bytes(ByteBuffer(string: "some data"))

    let response = try await HTTPClient.shared.execute(request, timeout: .seconds(30))
    if response.status == .ok {
        // handle response
    } else {
        // handle remote error
    }
} catch {
    // handle error
}
```

#### Using SwiftNIO EventLoopFuture

```swift
import AsyncHTTPClient

var request = try HTTPClient.Request(url: "https://apple.com/", method: .POST)
request.headers.add(name: "User-Agent", value: "Swift HTTPClient")
request.body = .string("some-body")

HTTPClient.shared.execute(request: request).whenComplete { result in
    switch result {
    case .failure(let error):
        // process error
    case .success(let response):
        if response.status == .ok {
            // handle response
        } else {
            // handle remote error
        }
    }
}
```

### Redirects following

The globally shared instance `HTTPClient.shared` follows redirects by default. If you create your own `HTTPClient`, you can enable the follow-redirects behavior using the client configuration:

```swift
let httpClient = HTTPClient(eventLoopGroupProvider: .singleton,
                            configuration: HTTPClient.Configuration(followRedirects: true))
```

### Timeouts
Timeouts (connect and read) can also be set using the client configuration:
```swift
let timeout = HTTPClient.Configuration.Timeout(connect: .seconds(1), read: .seconds(1))
let httpClient = HTTPClient(eventLoopGroupProvider: .singleton,
                            configuration: HTTPClient.Configuration(timeout: timeout))
```
or on a per-request basis:
```swift
httpClient.execute(request: request, deadline: .now() + .milliseconds(1))
```

### Streaming
When dealing with larger amount of data, it's critical to stream the response body instead of aggregating in-memory.
The following example demonstrates how to count the number of bytes in a streaming response body:

#### Using Swift Concurrency
```swift
do {
    let request = HTTPClientRequest(url: "https://apple.com/")
    let response = try await HTTPClient.shared.execute(request, timeout: .seconds(30))
    print("HTTP head", response)

    // if defined, the content-length headers announces the size of the body
    let expectedBytes = response.headers.first(name: "content-length").flatMap(Int.init)

    var receivedBytes = 0
    // asynchronously iterates over all body fragments
    // this loop will automatically propagate backpressure correctly
    for try await buffer in response.body {
        // for this example, we are just interested in the size of the fragment
        receivedBytes += buffer.readableBytes

        if let expectedBytes = expectedBytes {
            // if the body size is known, we calculate a progress indicator
            let progress = Double(receivedBytes) / Double(expectedBytes)
            print("progress: \(Int(progress * 100))%")
        }
    }
    print("did receive \(receivedBytes) bytes")
} catch {
    print("request failed:", error)
}
```

#### Using HTTPClientResponseDelegate and SwiftNIO EventLoopFuture

```swift
import NIOCore
import NIOHTTP1

class CountingDelegate: HTTPClientResponseDelegate {
    typealias Response = Int

    var count = 0

    func didSendRequestHead(task: HTTPClient.Task<Response>, _ head: HTTPRequestHead) {
        // this is executed right after request head was sent, called once
    }

    func didSendRequestPart(task: HTTPClient.Task<Response>, _ part: IOData) {
        // this is executed when request body part is sent, could be called zero or more times
    }

    func didSendRequest(task: HTTPClient.Task<Response>) {
        // this is executed when request is fully sent, called once
    }

    func didReceiveHead(
        task: HTTPClient.Task<Response>,
        _ head: HTTPResponseHead
    ) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        // this is executed when we receive HTTP response head part of the request
        // (it contains response code and headers), called once in case backpressure
        // is needed, all reads will be paused until returned future is resolved
        return task.eventLoop.makeSucceededFuture(())
    }

    func didReceiveBodyPart(
        task: HTTPClient.Task<Response>,
        _ buffer: ByteBuffer
    ) -> EventLoopFuture<Void> {
        // this is executed when we receive parts of the response body, could be called zero or more times
        count += buffer.readableBytes
        // in case backpressure is needed, all reads will be paused until returned future is resolved
        return task.eventLoop.makeSucceededFuture(())
    }

    func didFinishRequest(task: HTTPClient.Task<Response>) throws -> Int {
        // this is called when the request is fully read, called once
        // this is where you return a result or throw any errors you require to propagate to the client
        return count
    }

    func didReceiveError(task: HTTPClient.Task<Response>, _ error: Error) {
        // this is called when we receive any network-related error, called once
    }
}

let request = try HTTPClient.Request(url: "https://apple.com/")
let delegate = CountingDelegate()

HTTPClient.shared.execute(request: request, delegate: delegate).futureResult.whenSuccess { count in
    print(count)
}
```

### File downloads

Based on the `HTTPClientResponseDelegate` example above you can build more complex delegates,
the built-in `FileDownloadDelegate` is one of them. It allows streaming the downloaded data
asynchronously, while reporting the download progress at the same time, like in the following
example:

```swift
let request = try HTTPClient.Request(
    url: "https://swift.org/builds/development/ubuntu1804/latest-build.yml"
)

let delegate = try FileDownloadDelegate(path: "/tmp/latest-build.yml", reportProgress: {
    if let totalBytes = $0.totalBytes {
        print("Total bytes count: \(totalBytes)")
    }
    print("Downloaded \($0.receivedBytes) bytes so far")
})

HTTPClient.shared.execute(request: request, delegate: delegate).futureResult
    .whenSuccess { progress in
        if let totalBytes = progress.totalBytes {
            print("Final total bytes count: \(totalBytes)")
        }
        print("Downloaded finished with \(progress.receivedBytes) bytes downloaded")
    }
```

### Unix Domain Socket Paths
Connecting to servers bound to socket paths is easy:
```swift
HTTPClient.shared.execute(
    .GET,
    socketPath: "/tmp/myServer.socket",
    urlPath: "/path/to/resource"
).whenComplete (...)
```

Connecting over TLS to a unix domain socket path is possible as well:
```swift
HTTPClient.shared.execute(
    .POST,
    secureSocketPath: "/tmp/myServer.socket",
    urlPath: "/path/to/resource",
    body: .string("hello")
).whenComplete (...)
```

Direct URLs can easily be constructed to be executed in other scenarios:
```swift
let socketPathBasedURL = URL(
    httpURLWithSocketPath: "/tmp/myServer.socket",
    uri: "/path/to/resource"
)
let secureSocketPathBasedURL = URL(
    httpsURLWithSocketPath: "/tmp/myServer.socket",
    uri: "/path/to/resource"
)
```

### Disabling HTTP/2
The exclusive use of HTTP/1 is possible by setting `httpVersion` to `.http1Only` on `HTTPClient.Configuration`:
```swift
var configuration = HTTPClient.Configuration()
configuration.httpVersion = .http1Only
let client = HTTPClient(
    eventLoopGroupProvider: .singleton,
    configuration: configuration
)
```
